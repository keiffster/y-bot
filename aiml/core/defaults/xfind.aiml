                <li>Is there only one?</li>

                <li>There might be more than one.</li>
                <li>I need time to formulate the reply.</li>
                <li>I'll ask around and get back to you.</li>
                <li>I have to think about that one for a while.</li>
                <li>I will ask my botmaster,
                    <bot name="botmaster"/>
                    for the answer.
                </li>
                <li>I would look into the web for that knowledge.</li>
                <li>Does it have anything to do with

                <li>Do you use Explorer or another browser?</li>
                <li>That's not something I get asked all the time.</li>

                </li>
                <li>Check back later and see if I learn the answer to that one.</li>
                <li>That's an interesting question. I'll come back to that in a minute.</li>
                <li>You tell me.</li>
                <li>What is it to you?</li>
                <li>Are you testing me?</li>
                <li>I will search for it.</li>
                <li>I can ask my, <bot name="botmaster"/>.
                </li>
                <li>I will try to find out.</li>
                <li>I can ask someone about it.</li>
                <li>I would do a search for it.</li>

                <li>Try searching the web.</li>
                <li>Maybe my botmaster,
                    <bot name="botmaster"/>
                    knows the answer.
