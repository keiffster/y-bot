v0.1,   2012-11-03 -- Initial release.
v1.0,   2013-05-19 -- Adapted to new API structure.  Functionality extended.
v1.1,   2013-08-12 -- Compatibility with Python 2.x added.
v1.2,   2013-12-04 -- Added parsing of site elevation and improved versatility
                      in finding nearest sites to given coordinates.
v1.3,   2014-06-15 -- parse_val can now accept returned data with single
                      timesteps such as when a forecast has been requested
                      using the isotime parameter.
                      _query method of MetOffer class now returns raw API
                      output.  Methods which use this handle conversion from
                      json to Python objects.
		      Tuples in the data attribute of Weather instances
                      returned by parse_val are now 3-tuples (EXCEPT for
                      'timestamp').  The third element is the 'name' of the
                      measurement type as used by the API (e.g. 'T' for
                      'Temperature').
                      Separate function created to devise dict that maps Met
                      Office 'names' to description and measurement unit from
                      the raw returned data (extract_data_key).
v1.3.1, 2014-06-15 -- Fixed packaging error.
v1.3.2, 2014-06-16 -- Fixed docs.
